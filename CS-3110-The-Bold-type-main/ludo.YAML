This project simulates the operation of a video game called Ludo. 
The interface shows the ludo board with a dice, 4 sections and 16 pieces, 
including the color of the different sections. 
The users will be able to interactively choose where to move their pieces, 
and to interactively play with the pieces through the ludo board. 
As the users play, the pieces advance and have to go through the 
whole board without being captured by another user. 
If a user is captured then they will be sent back home.
To win the game, all four of your pieces must go through the board, 
and be in the final position.
